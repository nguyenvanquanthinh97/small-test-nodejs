# Test for some javascript


1. Code quality matters, write it cleanly
2. No need to find a perfect solution. The simplest solution is better

## How to 

1. Run `npm install`
2. Tests are run with `npm test`
3. I recommend running the tests on watch mode, so they update as they go `npm test -- --watch`
4. When you are done, run the linter to verify your code follows the format `npm run lint`. (If you are using vscode, the auto-save feature will help you)
